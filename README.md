# Python Mock Example

This repository can be used as a base for junior Python developers to practice mocking.
If the junior developer wants to apply Test Driven Development (TDD) he or she can apply the following steps:

## Testing `Driver.lock`

1. Create a test method in `test_driver.py` that uses a mock to test whether `Car.lock()` is called
1. Run the test and see that it fails.
1. Implement the `Driver.lock()` method so the test method passes.  

## Testing `Driver.unlock`

1. Create a test method in `test_driver.py` that uses a mock to test whether `Car.unlock()` is called
1. Run the test and see that it fails.
1. Implement the `Driver.unlock()` method so the test method passes.
